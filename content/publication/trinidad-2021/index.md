abstract: © The Author(s) 2020. Although evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in
  juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about
  their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities,
  transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the
  traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime
  literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque
  Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies,
  emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime
  patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest
  the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior
  patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting.
