abstract: Throughout the three last decades the study of the special and contextual
  variables associated with the delinquency has increased. The empirical evidence
  has signaled that the crimes are concentrated in specific spaces in the city and
  around certain type of facilities and services. Nevertheless, the studies in the
  south of Europe about this issue are certainly scarce, especially if it is about
  centering the analysis in juvenile population. The main objective is to explore
  the concentration of the juvenile delinquency in urban space and to study the types
  of predominant facilities in the resultant hotspots. For it, and under the theoretical
  framework that the situational perspectives could bring to, the offences committed
  by minors with data provided by the Basque country police (Spain) were analyzed
  – following a retrospective ex post facto methodology. Clusters of geolocated events
  have been obtained and, through an analysis of the areas of influence, a recount
  of the facilities that exist around those clusters has been done. The results indicate
  that concentration of the infringements exists in specific places in which certain
  facilities prevail over others.
