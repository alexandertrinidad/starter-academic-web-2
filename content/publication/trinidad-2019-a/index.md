abstract: 'Juvenile delinquency is influenced by opportunities and situations: the
  existing evidence has pointed out that variables such as leisure places or poor
  social cohesion are associated to offenses committed by youths. Considering the
  opportunity perspective, the current study aims to better understand the influence
  that situational and contextual factors have on juvenile (12–18 years old) delinquency
  in a southern European region. Police data from the municipalities of the Basque
  Country (located at the north of Spain) was analysed using a negative binomial regression,
  showing that opportunity related variables, such as non-risky leisure and population
  size, have significant positive effects on juvenile delinquency, whereas risky leisure
  opportunities, single-parent families or residential instability are not related
  to juvenile delinquency, suggesting that some predictors well established in the
  literature could not work as expected in certain cultural and geographic contexts.'
