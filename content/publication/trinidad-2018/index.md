abstract: 'This paper aims to summarise and integrate the accumulated knowledge on
  recent literature analysing the situational factors of juvenile delinquency and
  draw future avenues for research. A review of recent empirical papers published
  on two relevant databases allowed us to gather a sample of 88 papers published from
  2010 to 2017 that analyse the role of situational factors of delinquent behaviour
  using quantitative methods and applying one of the situational theories. The results
  highlight the robustness of some situational and environmental variables for a deeper
  understanding of juvenile antisocial behaviour by putting it into context. There
  is a considerable amount of evidence to corroborate the impact of unstructured leisure
  activities on antisocial behaviour, or the role of home location in establishing
  a geographic area of action. However, there is ambiguous evidence on other aspects:
  i.e. guardianship needs to be understood and measure in a more complex way, and
  the role of physical design of the places where juvenile delinquency happens deserves
  further analysis. Future research lines from this perspective are needed and will
  offer relevant improvements for better understanding juvenile delinquency and designing
  more effective preventive measures.'
