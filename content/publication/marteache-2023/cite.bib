	abstract = {Urban tourism is one of the fastest-growing segments within the tourist sector. Although the relationship between urban tourism and crime has been well documented in the literature, a focus on the specifics of tourist victimization is lacking. This study explores thefts against urban tourists using police records for the five main tourist districts in the city of Barcelona (Spain). We apply conjunctive analysis of case configurations to a large data sample (N {\textgreater} 300,000) to uncover victimization case profiles and the context in which crimes are committed. Comparisons to resident victimization provide valuable insight into this problem and set new avenues for future research.},
