abstract = {En estos {\'{u}}ltimos a{\~{n}}os las acciones delictivas cometidas por las personas menores de edad han tenido una gran repercusi{\'{o}}n social. El desconocimiento de las cifras oficiales sobre la delincuencia juvenil propicia que se perfilen caracter{\'{i}}sticas de menores infractores que no se corresponden con la realidad. Por ello, presentamos una revisi{\'{o}}n de las estad{\'{i}}sticas sobre las infracciones juveniles en la Comunidad Aut{\'{o}}noma del Pa{\'{i}}s Vasco durante el periodo del 2007-2012 en base al Instituto Nacional de Estad{\'{i}}stica (INE), compar{\'{a}}ndolas a nivel nacional. Teniendo en cuenta anteriores evaluaciones de la justicia juvenil en la CAPV realizadas por el Instituto Vasco de Criminolog{\'{i}}a, se ha querido hacer un an{\'{a}}lisis descriptivo mediante frecuencias de los datos obtenidos. De esta manera, tras la revisi{\'{o}}n de diferentes variables como el n{\'{u}}mero de infracciones cometidas, el sexo y el lugar de nacimiento, y su comparaci{\'{o}}n a nivel nacional con la CAPV, se han obtenido algunas conclusiones acerca del menor infractor en la Comunidad Aut{\'{o}}noma del Pa{\'{i}}s Vasco.

abstract = {This paper aims to summarise and integrate the accumulated knowledge on recent literature analysing the situational factors of juvenile delinquency and draw future avenues for research. A review of recent empirical papers published on two relevant databases allowed us to gather a sample of 88 papers published from 2010 to 2017 that analyse the role of situational factors of delinquent behaviour using quantitative methods and applying one of the situational theories. The results highlight the robustness of some situational and environmental variables for a deeper understanding of juvenile antisocial behaviour by putting it into context. There is a considerable amount of evidence to corroborate the impact of unstructured leisure activities on antisocial behaviour, or the role of home location in establishing a geographic area of action. However, there is ambiguous evidence on other aspects: i.e. guardianship needs to be understood and measure in a more complex way, and the role of physical design of the places where juvenile delinquency happens deserves further analysis. Future research lines from this perspective are needed and will offer relevant improvements for better understanding juvenile delinquency and designing more effective preventive measures.},

abstract = {Throughout the three last decades the study of the special and contextual variables associated with the delinquency has increased. The empirical evidence has signaled that the crimes are concentrated in specific spaces in the city and around certain type of facilities and services. Nevertheless, the studies in the south of Europe about this issue are certainly scarce, especially if it is about centering the analysis in juvenile population. The main objective is to explore the concentration of the juvenile delinquency in urban space and to study the types of predominant facilities in the resultant hotspots. For it, and under the theoretical framework that the situational perspectives could bring to, the offences committed by minors with data provided by the Basque country police (Spain) were analyzed – following a retrospective ex post facto methodology. Clusters of geolocated events have been obtained and, through an analysis of the areas of influence, a recount of the facilities that exist around those clusters has been done. The results indicate that concentration of the infringements exists in specific places in which certain facilities prevail over others.},

abstract = {Juvenile delinquency is influenced by opportunities and situations: the existing evidence has pointed out that variables such as leisure places or poor social cohesion are associated to offenses committed by youths. Considering the opportunity perspective, the current study aims to better understand the influence that situational and contextual factors have on juvenile (12–18 years old) delinquency in a southern European region. Police data from the municipalities of the Basque Country (located at the north of Spain) was analysed using a negative binomial regression, showing that opportunity related variables, such as non-risky leisure and population size, have significant positive effects on juvenile delinquency, whereas risky leisure opportunities, single-parent families or residential instability are not related to juvenile delinquency, suggesting that some predictors well established in the literature could not work as expected in certain cultural and geographic contexts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2020. Although evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities, transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies, emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting.},
