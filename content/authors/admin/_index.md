I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology ([ISS](https://iss-wiso.uni-koeln.de/en)) at the University of Cologne. Additionally, I am a research fellow at the [Crime Events in Context](https://nscr.nl/en/research-area/crime-events-in-context/) research group at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement ([NSCR](https://nscr.nl/en/about-us/organisation/fellows/)), and at the [Crim-Ap](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/dms/equipo) research group at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.

My research focuses on understanding the spatial and temporal variation of antisocial behavior, crime perceptions, and public opinion. I employ computational social science methods and research synthesis techniques to analyze complex social phenomena. Over the past few years, I have been actively learning and applying open science principles, working to enhance transparency and reproducibility in social research.
