I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology ([ISS](https://iss-wiso.uni-koeln.de/en)) at the University of Cologne. Additionally, I am a research fellow at the [Crime Events in Context](https://nscr.nl/en/research-area/crime-events-in-context/) research group at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement ([NSCR](https://nscr.nl/en/about-us/organisation/fellows/)), and at the [Crim-Ap](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/dms/equipo) research group at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.

My research interests revolve around understanding the distribution of social phenomena across time and space. Specifically, my primary focus has been on studying the spatial and temporal variations of crime and its correlates. I am also passionate about exploring new methods and measurements for understanding emotion perception.
